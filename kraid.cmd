;---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 2. State entry
; --------------
; This is where you define what commands bring you to what states.
;
; Each state entry block looks like:
;   [State -1, Label]           ;Change Label to any name you want to use to
;                               ;identify the state with.
;   type = ChangeState          ;Don't change this
;   value = new_state_number
;   trigger1 = command = command_name
;   . . .  (any additional triggers)
;
; - new_state_number is the number of the state to change to
; - command_name is the name of the command (from the section above)
; - Useful triggers to know:
;   - statetype
;       S, C or A : current state-type of player (stand, crouch, air)
;   - ctrl
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player has control. Unless "interrupting" another
;                move, you'll want ctrl = 1
;   - stateno
;       number of state player is in - useful for "move interrupts"
;   - movecontact
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player's last attack touched the opponent
;                useful for "move interrupts"
;
; Note: The order of state entry is important.
;   State entry with a certain command must come before another state
;   entry with a command that is the subset of the first.  
;   For example, command "fwd_a" must be listed before "a", and
;   "fwd_ab" should come before both of the others.
;
; For reference on triggers, see CNS documentation.
;
; Just for your information (skip if you're not interested):
; This part is an extension of the CNS. "State -1" is a special state
; that is executed once every game-tick, regardless of what other state
; you are in.

;==================================================================================
;======| RELACIONADO À AI - AI RELATED |===========================================
;==================================================================================

; The main purpose of having these next two controllers here at the top of
; StateDef -1 is to make sure the AI helper never changes to a different state,
; but they also improve efficiency by preventing Mugen from wasting time
; processing the entire State -1 for the helper.
[State -1, AI Helper Check]
type = ChangeState
trigger1 = IsHelper(9741)
value = 9741

[State -1, AI Helper Check 2]
type = ChangeState
trigger1 = IsHelper(9742)
value = 9742

; This is generally the best place to put most of your AI directives.  For
; example, this controller would only be executed when the CPU is in control:
;
; [State -1, Haha!]
; type = ChangeState
; trigger1 = var(0) ; (Or use "var(59)>0" if you've chosen not to
;                   ; use the Simplifier variable/controller.)
; trigger1 = ctrl
; trigger1 = (StateType = S)
; trigger1 = (MoveType = I)
; trigger1 = (P2MoveType = H)
; trigger1 = (NumEnemy = 1)
; trigger1 = (Enemy,GetHitVar(HitTime) > 60)
; trigger1 = (PrevStateNo != 195)
; trigger1 = (Random < 99)
; value = 195

; And of course, most human-only command-based ChangeStates also belong
; in State -1.  For example, this move would only be performable by a human:
;
; [State -1, Death Before Dishonor]
; type = ChangeState
; trigger1 = (command = "suicide")
; trigger1 = !var(0) ; (Or use "var(59)<1" if you've chosen not to
;                    ; use the Simplifier variable/controller.)
; trigger1 = ctrl
; trigger1 = (StateType != A)
; trigger1 = (MoveType = I)
; value = {suicide state number}
